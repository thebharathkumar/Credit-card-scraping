# HDFC Credit Cards Frontend

A modern, responsive web application to view and explore HDFC Bank credit card data scraped from their official website.

## Features

- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean and professional interface with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across card names, rewards, benefits, and lounge access
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter cards by categories (All, Lounge Access, High Rewards)
- **Detailed Card View**: Click on any card to view complete details in a modal
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Beautiful Cards Grid**: Cards displayed in an attractive grid layout with hover effects

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: Flask is already included in the requirements.txt file.

2. Make sure you have the credit card data:
   - The application reads from `card.csv` in the project root
   - You can run the scraper first to generate this data

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. The application will automatically load and display the credit card data

## Project Structure

```

├── app.py                      # Flask backend server
├── templates/
│   └── index.html             # Main HTML template
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css          # Styling and responsive design

├── card.csv                   # Credit card data (generated by scraper)
└── FRONTEND_README.md         # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Backend (app.py)**: Flask server that serves the HTML template and provides an API endpoint (`/api/cards`) to fetch credit card data from the CSV file

2. **Frontend (index.html)**: Contains the structure of the web page including header, search box, filter buttons, cards grid, and modal for detailed view

3. **Styling (style.css)**: Modern CSS with:
   - CSS Grid for responsive card layout
   - Flexbox for component alignment
   - Custom color scheme matching HDFC branding
   - Smooth transitions and animations
   - Mobile-first responsive design

4. **Logic (script.js)**: JavaScript handling:
   - Fetching data from the API
   - Parsing CSV data into structured format
   - Real-time search filtering
   - Category filtering
   - Modal popup for detailed card information
   - Dynamic card rendering

## Usage

### Searching Cards
- Type in the search box to filter cards by name, rewards, benefits, or lounge access
- Search is case-insensitive and searches across all card attributes

### Filtering Cards
- **All Cards**: Shows all available credit cards
- **Lounge Access**: Shows only cards with airport lounge access
- **High Rewards**: Shows cards with high reward rates (5X, 10X, 5% cashback, etc.)

### Viewing Card Details
- Click on any card or the "View Details" link to see complete information
- Modal displays full details including:
  - Card fees
  - Fee reversal conditions
  - Complete rewards and benefits list
  - Lounge access details
  - Milestone benefits

## API Endpoints

### GET /
Returns the main HTML page

### GET /api/cards
Returns JSON array of credit card data

Example response:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "MoneyBack+ Credit Card",
    "card_fee": "500",
    "card_fee_reversal": "Waived on annual spends above 1 lakh",
    "rewards": "10X CashPoints on select merchants...",
    "lounge_access": "8 Complimentary Domestic Airport Lounge access annually",
    "milestone_benefits": "Gift vouchers worth upto ₹2000 annually"
  }
]
```

## Customization

### Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `static/css/style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #004c8c;
    --secondary-color: #ed232a;
    --accent-color: #f26522;
    /* ... more colors */
}
```

### Layout
Modify the grid layout in `static/css/style.css`:
```css
.cards-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(350px, 1fr));
    gap: 25px;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 5000 is already in use, modify `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Change port number
```

### No Data Showing
- Ensure `card.csv` exists in the project root
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Verify the API endpoint returns data: `http://localhost:5000/api/cards`

### Styling Issues
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check that CSS and JS files are being served correctly
- Verify file paths in the browser's Network tab

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

Minimum versions: Any modern browser from the last 2 years

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0
- **Data Format**: CSV

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add sorting functionality (by name, fees, rewards)
- [ ] Export filtered results to Excel/PDF
- [ ] Comparison feature (compare multiple cards side-by-side)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] More filter options (by fee range, reward type)
- [ ] Integration with live scraping (trigger scraper from UI)
